    <h2>What STEP is trying to build</h2>

    <p>
      STEP is the UK’s programme to design and deliver a prototype fusion power plant at West Burton (Nottinghamshire),
      with first operation targeted for around 2040.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key technical milestone is net electricity export. The prototype must demonstrate at least
      <strong>100 MWe net</strong> to the national grid to be considered a success.
    </p>

    <p>
      STEP is pursuing a spherical tokamak, a more compact tokamak geometry (often described as “apple core” rather than
      doughnut-shaped). The idea is that a smaller, potentially simpler machine could reduce the cost and complexity of
      reaching a power plant prototype, while remaining relevant to later designs.
    </p>

    <p>
      UK policy (as discussed in a Royal Society theme issue paper) frames STEP as an anchor project intended to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>derisk private investment</li>
      <li>build supply chains</li>
      <li>support intellectual property and engineering talent well before 2040</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Funding and timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Initial concept phase funding:</strong> government provided £222 million for STEP’s early work to produce a
        concept design by 2024.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Design-to-build decision point:</strong> the programme aim is a fully evolved design and approvals to build
        by 2032, enabling construction with operations targeted around 2040.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Major later commitment:</strong> in June 2025 the UK announced £2.5 billion investment in fusion, explicitly
        including support for the STEP prototype at West Burton.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A central economic challenge</h2>

    <p>
      Fusion plants can have large internal electricity demands (magnets, heating and current drive, cryogenics, coolant
      circulation, site power). An IAEA conference paper on STEP’s power and cooling architecture illustrates how large
      the internal load can be for a prototype.
    </p>

    <p>One example indicates roughly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(925 MWe) gross generation</li>
      <li>(750 MWe) required to run plant subsystems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That is economically relevant because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>high internal energy demand pushes up capital and operational expenditure</li>
      <li>net output per unit of hardware affects the learning curve and eventual levelised costs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>National economic impact estimates (model-based, 2019 to 2065)</h2>

    <p>
      A partner-commissioned economic impact assessment summary (AMION Consulting, March 2025) reports, at UK level:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Annual average GVA: £1.5 billion per year</li>
      <li>Annual average employment: about 19,470 job-years per year</li>
      <li>Cumulative totals (2019 to 2065): £65,982m GVA (about £66bn) and 856,724 job-years</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are not guarantees. They are outputs of a modelling approach with assumptions about supply chain capture,
      phasing, and workforce patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Regional and local impacts</h2>

    <h3>West Burton campus scale and on-site jobs</h3>

    <p>
      Once fully developed and operational in the 2040s, the West Burton site is anticipated to accommodate 6,500 FTE jobs,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>about 1,500 at STEP</li>
      <li>about 5,000 on an associated business park</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is described as roughly 12.5% of current total workplace jobs in Bassetlaw.
    </p>

    <h3>Annual average GVA and jobs by area (2019 to 2065 averages)</h3>

    <p>From the same summary table:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bassetlaw: £150.9m annual average GVA; 1,966 annual average jobs</li>
      <li>West Lindsey: £102.9m annual average GVA; 1,329 annual average jobs</li>
      <li>Nottinghamshire (county): £295.3m annual average GVA; 3,843 annual average jobs</li>
      <li>Lincolnshire (county): £197.8m annual average GVA; 2,563 annual average jobs</li>
      <li>East Midlands Combined County Authority area (EMCCA): £402.5m annual average GVA; 5,237 annual average jobs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A Nottinghamshire County Council news release summarising the same research also reports:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nottinghamshire economy boosted by £86m to £210m per year for the next 40 years (modelled)</li>
      <li>more than 6,500 jobs per year could benefit Nottinghamshire residents at peak operations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wider economic effects (enabling impacts)</h2>

    <p>The March 2025 impact summary also includes quantified enabling impacts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skills: during construction, 1,200 people trained in skilled areas (welding, electrical, mechanical) and 330 apprenticeships</li>
      <li>
        Campus space: about 180,000 sqm of on-site office, lab and research and ancillary space, plus 81,000 sqm off-site space
        associated with STEP-related inward investment
      </li>
      <li>Indirect commercial floorspace (UK-level): over 440,000 sqm estimated to accommodate indirect activity, mostly post-2040</li>
      <li>Housing demand: over 2,800 homes in the “immediate geography” by 2065 (with phasing indicated)</li>
      <li>Innovation indicators: up to 250 new patents (2019 to 2065), 117 spinouts, accommodating about 1,570 jobs (with explicit uncertainty noted)</li>
      <li>
        Wage premia: at peak employment, STEP jobs associated with £65m per annum wage premium benefits and business park jobs
        £26m per annum
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Governance, industrial strategy, and why West Burton</h2>

    <p>
      STEP is delivered by UK Industrial Fusion Solutions (UKIFS), a UKAEA subsidiary, using an integrated alliance delivery
      model combining public and private partners.
    </p>

    <p>
      West Burton was selected in October 2022, and government communications frame the project as “fossil to fusion”, reusing
      an established power-generation location in “Megawatt Valley”.
    </p>

    <h2>Regulation</h2>

    <p>
      The UK has chosen a regulatory route that treats fusion differently from fission. Government factsheets state that fusion
      facilities are excluded from the nuclear site licensing regime and regulated instead by the Health and Safety Executive
      and environmental regulators, rather than the Office for Nuclear Regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearer and less imposing regulation can reduce project timing risk, shorten timelines, and widen the pool of suppliers.
