An overview of Europe’s fusion reactors for the general reader.

For an exhaustive list, down to university-scale machines, the IAEA’s fusion device database is the best resource available.

## Major fusion facilities in Europe

### Magnetic confinement

- **ITER** (France, Saint-Paul-lès-Durance)  
  The famed international tokamak under construction since 2010, designed to demonstrate \( Q \ge 10 \) burning plasmas.

- **WEST** (France, Cadarache)  
  A tokamak focused on long-pulse operation and tungsten plasma-facing components relevant to ITER. Recently set a European long-duration plasma record (22+ minutes).

- **JET** (UK, Culham)  
  Europe’s former flagship tokamak. Operations ended in Dec 2023 and the site is moving into decommissioning and repurposing.

- **MAST Upgrade (MAST-U)** (UK, Culham)  
  A spherical tokamak testing compact-reactor technologies and the Super-X divertor concept to reduce exhaust heat loads.

- **ASDEX Upgrade** (Germany, Garching)  
  A leading divertor tokamak used to develop physics and operating scenarios relevant to ITER and future reactors.

- **Wendelstein 7-X** (Germany, Greifswald)  
  The world’s largest stellarator, built to demonstrate reactor-optimised stellarator concepts using complex magnetic geometries aimed at stable confinement and long-pulse operation.

- **TEXTOR** (Germany, Jülich, retired)  
  A tokamak that ran for about 30 years and shut down in 2013. Historically important for plasma-wall interaction and materials studies.

- **TCV** (Switzerland, Lausanne, EPFL)  
  A variable-configuration tokamak known for flexible plasma shaping used to study confinement, stability, and divertor concepts relevant to ITER and beyond.

- **TJ-II** (Spain, Madrid)  
  A flexible stellarator and Spain’s flagship magnetic confinement device.

- **RFX-mod2** (Italy, Padua)  
  A major reversed-field pinch (RFP) experiment, an alternative magnetic confinement concept with emphasis on stability and control.

- **FTU** (Italy, Frascati, retired and being dismantled)  
  A compact high-field tokamak at ENEA Frascati. The site is now being cleared for the DTT facility, with FTU disassembly activities reported in 2024.

- **DTT** (Italy, Frascati, under construction)  
  Divertor Tokamak Test facility, focused on divertor technologies at relevant heat loads for the next era of designs.

- **EXTRAP T2R** (Sweden, Stockholm, KTH)  
  An RFP facility used heavily for stability studies and active feedback control of resistive wall modes.

- **ISTTOK** (Portugal, Lisbon)  
  A compact tokamak at Instituto Superior Técnico, used as a flexible research platform including AC-operation studies.

- **COMPASS-U** (Czech Republic, Prague, in development)  
  Successor to the COMPASS tokamak program, being constructed at the Institute of Plasma Physics for ITER-relevant research.

- **GOLEM** (Czech Republic, Prague)  
  A small tokamak used for education and remote experimentation, operated at the Czech Technical University.

### Inertial fusion and high-energy-density facilities

- **LMJ / PETAL** (France, near Bordeaux)  
  Laser Mégajoule is a major high-energy-density and inertial-fusion research facility. PETAL adds a high-power petawatt beam coupled to LMJ.

- **Vulcan 20-20** (UK, Harwell Campus, RAL)  
  The Vulcan laser facility has been decommissioned to enable the Vulcan 20-20 upgrade, aimed at much higher power for high-energy-density physics and fusion research.

- **PALS** (Czech Republic, Prague)  
  Prague Asterix Laser System, a major European laser facility researching high-energy-density plasma physics and inertial-fusion science.

## The next steps in Europe’s fusion pipeline

### ITER’s job in the fusion power pipeline

ITER is not a project to realise commercial fusion, but rather an experiment commissioned to achieve a \( Q > 10 \) plasma gain and help develop the next generation of tokamaks.

ITER’s research plan has been delayed since its conception in the 2010s. In the current timings, the project is estimated to reach full magnetic energy around 2036, with operation beginning around 2039.

This matters because ITER is the most prominent project available to us that lets us:

- run stable, high-power plasmas and control them reliably
- manage heat exhaust and plasma-facing components under reactor conditions
- validate physical models needed in the design of the next generation reactors

### DEMO

In Europe’s roadmap, DEMO is framed as ITER’s successor and is seen to be the point where fusion becomes an electricity-producing technology and not just plasma physics.

DEMO’s role is to demonstrate fusion power delivery to the grid, as well as essential operational factors such as maintainability, the fuel cycle, and tritium breeding. Europe is actively reviewing and maturing DEMO concepts.

### STEP: the UK’s prototype power plant

The UK’s STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production) programme aims for a prototype fusion power plant by 2040, planned for the West Burton site.

Work on spherical tokamaks like MAST-U is directly relevant to compact reactor layouts and divertor technologies that STEP will need to develop at power-plant scale.

### Stellarators and alternatives

Tokamaks are widely regarded as the most promising route to DEMO, but Europe is also seriously considering alternatives, especially stellarators. If engineered well enough, stellarators may offer steady-state operation without the same disruption challenges tokamaks need to actively control.

Alongside publicly funded stellarator research (Wendelstein 7-X), Europe also has a private effort spun out from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics: Proxima Fusion. The company is pursuing an optimised, high-field stellarator power-plant concept.

## Takeaway

When fusion achieves its goals of large-scale energy to the grid, it is unlikely to be a single machine that appears fully formed.

What do you see as the biggest issue that fusion must face to change from experimental machines to power production?
