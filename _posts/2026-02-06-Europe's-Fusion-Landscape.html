<h2 id="pipeline">The next steps in Europe’s fusion pipeline</h2>

<h3>ITER’s job in the fusion power pipeline</h3>
<p>
  ITER is not a project to realise commercial fusion, but rather an experiment commissioned to achieve a \( Q &gt; 10 \)
  plasma gain and help develop the next generation of tokamaks.
</p>
<p>
  ITER’s research plan has been delayed since its conception in the 2010s. In the current timings, the project is estimated to reach full magnetic energy around 2036, with operation beginning around 2039.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>What ITER enables:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>stable, high-power plasmas and reliable control</li>
    <li>heat exhaust and plasma-facing components under reactor-like conditions</li>
    <li>validation of models used to design the next machines</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>DEMO</h3>
<p>
  In Europe’s roadmap, DEMO is framed as ITER’s successor and is seen to be the point where fusion becomes an electricity-producing technology and not just plasma physics.
</p>
<p>
  DEMO’s role is to demonstrate fusion power delivery to the grid, as well as maintainability, the fuel cycle, and tritium breeding. Europe is actively reviewing and maturing DEMO concepts.
</p>

<h3>STEP: the UK’s prototype power plant</h3>
<p>
  The UK’s STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production) programme aims for a prototype fusion power plant by 2040, planned for the West Burton site.
</p>
<p>
  Work on spherical tokamaks like MAST-U is directly relevant to compact reactor layouts and divertor technologies that STEP will need to develop at power-plant scale.
</p>

<h3>Stellarators and alternatives</h3>
<p>
  Tokamaks are widely regarded as the most promising route to DEMO, but Europe is also seriously considering alternatives, especially stellarators.
  If engineered well enough, stellarators may offer steady-state operation without the same disruption challenges tokamaks need to actively control.
</p>
<p>
  Alongside publicly funded stellarator research (Wendelstein 7-X), Europe also has a private effort spun out from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics: Proxima Fusion.
  The company is pursuing an optimised, high-field stellarator power-plant concept.
</p>

<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>
  When fusion achieves its goals of large-scale energy to the grid, it is unlikely to be a single machine that appears fully formed.

<p>
  What do you see as the biggest issue that fusion must face to change from experimental machines to power production?
