    <h2>The next steps in Europe’s fusion pipeline</h2>

    <h3>ITER’s job in the fusion power pipeline</h3>
    <p>
      ITER is not a project to realise commercial fusion, but rather an experiment commissioned to achieve a \( Q &gt; 10 \)
      plasma gain and help develop the next generation of tokamaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ITER’s research plan has been delayed since its conception in the 2010s. In the current timings, the project is estimated to reach full magnetic energy around 2036, with operation beginning around 2039.
    </p>
    <p>This matters because ITER is the most prominent project available to us that lets us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>run stable, high-power plasmas and control them reliably</li>
      <li>manage heat exhaust and plasma-facing components under reactor conditions</li>
      <li>validate physical models needed in the design of the next generation reactors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DEMO</h3>
    <p>
      In Europe’s roadmap, DEMO is framed as ITER’s successor and is seen to be the point where fusion becomes an electricity-producing technology and not just plasma physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEMO’s role is to demonstrate fusion power delivery to the grid, as well as essential operational factors such as maintainability, the fuel cycle, and tritium breeding. Europe is actively reviewing and maturing DEMO concepts.
    </p>

    <h3>STEP: the UK’s prototype power plant</h3>
    <p>
      The UK’s STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production) programme aims for a prototype fusion power plant by 2040, planned for the West Burton site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work on spherical tokamaks like MAST-U is directly relevant to compact reactor layouts and divertor technologies that STEP will need to develop at power-plant scale.
    </p>

    <h3>Stellarators and alternatives</h3>
    <p>
      Tokamaks are widely regarded as the most promising route to DEMO, but Europe is also seriously considering alternatives, especially stellarators.
      If engineered well enough, stellarators may offer steady-state operation without the same disruption challenges tokamaks need to actively control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside publicly funded stellarator research (Wendelstein 7-X), Europe also has a private effort spun out from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics: Proxima Fusion.
      The company is pursuing an optimised, high-field stellarator power-plant concept.
    </p>

    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      When fusion achieves its goals of large-scale energy to the grid, it is unlikely to be a single machine that appears fully formed.

    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p>
      What do you see as the biggest issue that fusion must face to change from experimental machines to power production?
    </p>

    <h2>Answer</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest single issue is not “making fusion happen” once, it is making a plant that can run reliably for years: high availability, maintainable hardware, and predictable economics.
      In practice that bundles together a few hard, connected constraints: the plasma has to be controlled without frequent disruptions, the exhaust power must be handled without destroying the divertor and first wall, and the neutron environment must be survived while still allowing remote maintenance and fast component replacement.
      If a device cannot keep its plasma-facing components and internal structures alive long enough, and cannot be serviced quickly enough, the electricity cost and downtime dominate even if the physics performance is excellent.
