## What STEP is trying to build

STEP is the UK’s programme to design and deliver a prototype fusion power plant at West Burton (Nottinghamshire), with first operation targeted for around 2040.

A key technical milestone is net electricity export. The prototype must demonstrate at least \(100 \, \mathrm{MWe}\) net to the national grid to be considered a success.

STEP is pursuing a spherical tokamak, a more compact tokamak geometry (often described as “apple core” rather than doughnut-shaped). The idea is that a smaller, potentially simpler machine could reduce the cost and complexity of reaching a power plant prototype, while remaining relevant to later designs.

UK policy (as discussed in a Royal Society theme issue paper) frames STEP as an anchor project intended to:

- derisk private investment
- build supply chains
- support intellectual property and engineering talent well before 2040

## Funding and timeline

- Initial concept phase funding: government provided £222 million for STEP’s early work to produce a concept design by 2024.
- Design-to-build decision point: the programme aim is a fully evolved design and approvals to build by 2032, enabling construction with operations targeted around 2040.
- Major later commitment: in June 2025 the UK announced £2.5 billion investment in fusion, explicitly including support for the STEP prototype at West Burton.

## A central economic challenge

Fusion plants can have large internal electricity demands (magnets, heating and current drive, cryogenics, coolant circulation, site power). An IAEA conference paper on STEP’s power and cooling architecture illustrates how large the internal load can be for a prototype.

One example indicates roughly:

- \(925 \, \mathrm{MWe}\) gross generation
- \(750 \, \mathrm{MWe}\) required to run plant subsystems

That is economically relevant because:

- high internal energy demand pushes up capital and operational expenditure
- net output per unit of hardware affects the learning curve and eventual levelised costs

## National economic impact estimates (model-based, 2019 to 2065)

A partner-commissioned economic impact assessment summary (AMION Consulting, March 2025) reports, at UK level:

- Annual average GVA: £1.5 billion per year
- Annual average employment: about 19,470 job-years per year
- Cumulative totals (2019 to 2065): £65,982m GVA (about £66bn) and 856,724 job-years

These are not guarantees. They are outputs of a modelling approach with assumptions about supply chain capture, phasing, and workforce patterns.

## Regional and local impacts

### West Burton campus scale and on-site jobs

Once fully developed and operational in the 2040s, the West Burton site is anticipated to accommodate 6,500 FTE jobs, including:

- about 1,500 at STEP
- about 5,000 on an associated business park

This is described as roughly 12.5% of current total workplace jobs in Bassetlaw.

### Annual average GVA and jobs by area (2019 to 2065 averages)

From the same summary table:

- Bassetlaw: £150.9m annual average GVA; 1,966 annual average jobs
- West Lindsey: £102.9m annual average GVA; 1,329 annual average jobs
- Nottinghamshire (county): £295.3m annual average GVA; 3,843 annual average jobs
- Lincolnshire (county): £197.8m annual average GVA; 2,563 annual average jobs
- East Midlands Combined County Authority area (EMCCA): £402.5m annual average GVA; 5,237 annual average jobs

A Nottinghamshire County Council news release summarising the same research also reports:

- Nottinghamshire economy boosted by £86m to £210m per year for the next 40 years (modelled)
- more than 6,500 jobs per year could benefit Nottinghamshire residents at peak operations

## Wider economic effects (enabling impacts)

The March 2025 impact summary also includes quantified enabling impacts:

- Skills: during construction, 1,200 people trained in skilled areas (welding, electrical, mechanical) and 330 apprenticeships
- Campus space: about 180,000 sqm of on-site office, lab and research and ancillary space, plus 81,000 sqm off-site space associated with STEP-related inward investment
- Indirect commercial floorspace (UK-level): over 440,000 sqm estimated to accommodate indirect activity, mostly post-2040
- Housing demand: over 2,800 homes in the “immediate geography” by 2065 (with phasing indicated)
- Innovation indicators: up to 250 new patents (2019 to 2065), 117 spinouts, accommodating about 1,570 jobs (with explicit uncertainty noted)
- Wage premia: at peak employment, STEP jobs associated with £65m per annum wage premium benefits and business park jobs £26m per annum

## Governance, industrial strategy, and why West Burton

STEP is delivered by UK Industrial Fusion Solutions (UKIFS), a UKAEA subsidiary, using an integrated alliance delivery model combining public and private partners.

West Burton was selected in October 2022, and government communications frame the project as “fossil to fusion”, reusing an established power-generation location in “Megawatt Valley”.

## Regulation

The UK has chosen a regulatory route that treats fusion differently from fission. Government factsheets state that fusion facilities are excluded from the nuclear site licensing regime and regulated instead by the Health and Safety Executive and environmental regulators, rather than the Office for Nuclear Regulation.

Clearer and less imposing regulation can reduce project timing risk, shorten timelines, and widen the pool of suppliers.

What do you think is the biggest economic risk to STEP achieving net electricity export by 2040?
