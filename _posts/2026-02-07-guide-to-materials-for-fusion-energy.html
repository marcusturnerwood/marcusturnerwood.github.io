    <p>
      Fusion is commonly seen as a plasma physics challenge, but the role of materials science cannot be understated.
      A commercial device has to survive years of operation while three stresses act on the materials used in the production
      of these power plants:
    </p>

    <h2>Three material stresses that dominate fusion design</h2>

    <h3>Extreme heat flux at the plasma boundary</h3>
    <p>
      The divertor and first wall must tolerate intense thermal loads without cracking, melting, or eroding.
    </p>

    <h3>Fast-neutron damage</h3>
    <p>
      High-energy neutrons displace atoms, generate parasitic helium and hydrogen in materials, and degrade strength,
      toughness, and dimensional stability.
    </p>

    <h3>Tritium, permeation, and contamination control</h3>
    <p>
      If the main reaction is deuterium tritium (D–T), a fusion plant needs continual production of Tritium.
      Tritium readily permeates many metals at high temperatures, so leakage, migration into structures, and cross-contamination
      of coolant and vacuum systems must be considered in design and operation.
    </p>

    <h2>The core materials</h2>

    <h3>Plasma-facing wall</h3>
    <p>
      The industry is converging on tungsten as the leading plasma-facing armour choice. The case for tungsten is its extremely
      high melting point, relatively low sputtering, and lower tritium retention than alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty is that tungsten is brittle. It can crack under thermal shock and irradiation, which can constrain operating
      time. That is why there is ongoing work on tungsten composites, engineered architectures, joining processes, and coatings.
    </p>

    <h3>Structural materials</h3>
    <p>
      For blankets and first-wall structures, reduced-activation ferritic-martensitic steels (RAFM) are among the most promising
      candidates. The challenge is meeting strength, ductility, fracture toughness, corrosion compatibility with coolants, and
      radiation tolerance, while keeping activation low enough for manageable end-of-life waste.
    </p>

    <h3>Tritium breeding materials</h3>
    <p>
      A D–T plant must breed tritium to close the fuel cycle, which makes breeding blankets and tritium extraction systems
      essential to scale-up.
    </p>
    <p>EU reference concepts often cite ceramic breeders such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>lithium orthosilicate: Li<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub></li>
      <li>lithium metatitanate: Li<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Breeder ceramics must survive thermal cycling and irradiation, maintain porosity, avoid swelling and cracking, and interact
      safely with purge gases and extraction technologies.
    </p>

    <h3>High-field magnets</h3>
    <p>
      Compact, high-field magnets require high-temperature superconducting tape, especially REBCO (Rare Earth Barium Copper Oxide).
      Key difficulties include uniformity along long lengths, joint resistance, quench management, mechanical strain tolerance, and
      radiation effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when coils sit outside the main cavity, neutrons can still degrade superconducting performance, pushing designs toward
      greater shielding.
    </p>

    <h3>Vacuum and tritium-compatible technologies</h3>
    <p>
      Fusion devices require vacuum integrity and ultra-clean gas handling under high radiation and thermal conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>How people invest around fusion materials (non-advice)</h2>
    <p>
      A common approach is to group “picks and shovels” into baskets that can still make sense even if fusion timelines shift,
      because they are supported by adjacent markets (semiconductors, electrification, nuclear services, metrology).
    </p>

    <h3>Four baskets</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>superconducting and magnet infrastructure</li>
      <li>vacuum and ultra-clean technology</li>
      <li>refractory metals and consistent tungsten supply</li>
      <li>scientific verification systems (testing, irradiation, metrology, QA)</li>
    </ul>
