<p class="lede">
  Fusion is often framed as a plasma physics challenge, but the path to a power plant depends on materials that can survive years of heat, neutrons, and tritium.

  <strong>Key idea:</strong> In power-plant conditions, materials limits often decide performance limits.

<h2 id="stresses">Three material stresses that dominate fusion design</h2>

<section class="grid">
  <article class="card">
    <h3>Extreme heat flux <span class="meta">plasma boundary</span></h3>
    <p>The divertor and first wall must tolerate intense thermal loads without cracking, melting, or eroding.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="card">
    <h3>Fast-neutron damage <span class="meta">bulk degradation</span></h3>
    <p>High-energy neutrons displace atoms, generate helium and hydrogen, and degrade strength, toughness, and dimensional stability.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="card">
    <h3>Tritium and permeation <span class="meta">fuel cycle</span></h3>
    <p>Tritium permeates many metals at high temperatures, so leakage, migration, and cross-contamination must be controlled.</p>
  </article>
</section>

<section class="grid">
  <article class="card">
    <h3>Plasma-facing wall <span class="meta">armour</span></h3>
    <p>
      The industry is converging on tungsten as the leading plasma-facing armour choice due to its very high melting point,
      relatively low sputtering, and lower tritium retention than many alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty is brittleness: tungsten can crack under thermal shock and irradiation, motivating composites, engineered architectures,
      joining processes, and coatings.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="card">
    <h3>Structural materials <span class="meta">blankets and first wall</span></h3>
    <p>
      Reduced-activation ferritic-martensitic steels (RAFM) are among the most promising candidates. The challenge is meeting strength,
      ductility, fracture toughness, corrosion compatibility with coolants, and radiation tolerance while keeping activation low enough
      for manageable end-of-life waste.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="card">
    <h3>Tritium breeding materials <span class="meta">fuel cycle closure</span></h3>
    <p>
      A D–T plant must breed tritium to close the fuel cycle, making breeding blankets and extraction systems essential to scale-up.
    </p>
    <p>EU reference concepts often cite ceramic breeders such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>lithium orthosilicate: Li<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub></li>
      <li>lithium metatitanate: Li<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Breeder ceramics must survive thermal cycling and irradiation, maintain porosity, avoid swelling and cracking, and interact safely
      with purge gases and extraction technologies.
    </p>

  <article class="card">
    <h3>High-field magnets <span class="meta">HTS</span></h3>
    <p>
      Compact, high-field magnets require high-temperature superconducting tape, especially REBCO. Key difficulties include uniformity along long lengths,
      joint resistance, quench management, mechanical strain tolerance, and radiation effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when coils sit outside the main cavity, neutrons can still degrade superconducting performance, pushing designs toward greater shielding.
    </p>

  <article class="card">
    <h3>Vacuum and tritium-compatible tech <span class="meta">plant systems</span></h3>
    <p>
      Fusion devices require vacuum integrity and ultra-clean gas handling under high radiation and thermal conditions.

<h2 id="investing">How people invest around fusion materials (non-advice)</h2>

<p>
  A common approach is to group “picks and shovels” into baskets that can still make sense even if fusion timelines shift,
  because they are supported by adjacent markets (semiconductors, electrification, nuclear services, metrology).
</p>

<h3>Four baskets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>superconducting and magnet infrastructure</li>
  <li>vacuum and ultra-clean technology</li>
  <li>refractory metals and consistent tungsten supply</li>
  <li>scientific verification systems (testing, irradiation, metrology, QA)</li>
</ul>
