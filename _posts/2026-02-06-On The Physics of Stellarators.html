    <p>
      Fusion power is the idea of getting energy the same way the Sun does, by fusing light nuclei together.
      Fusion needs fuel at extremely high temperatures, so hot that matter turns into a gas of ionised atoms called a
      <em>plasma</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At these temperatures, you cannot confine the fuel in a normal container. If plasma touches the wall, it cools
      instantly and can damage the machine. That means the core engineering problem becomes:
    </p>

    <p><strong>How do you hold something hotter than any material can survive?</strong></p>

    <p>
      The most common answer is magnetic confinement, holding plasmas in place using forces generated by large magnets.
    </p>

    <h2>Magnetic fields</h2>

    <p>
      Plasma is made of charged particles. Charged particles respond strongly to magnetic fields. In a strong field they
      tend to spiral around, and travel along, magnetic field lines. When the field lines are arranged in the right
      configuration, particles mostly stay away from the walls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fusion devices use a donut-shaped chamber (a torus) as the vessel geometry, but a simple magnetic field going
      around a donut does not work well. The field is stronger on the inner side than the outer side, and it is curved,
      which causes particles to drift sideways. Over time, that drift leads to leakage.
    </p>

    <p>To fix that, the field lines need to do something special:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>they must twist as they go around the donut</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      That twist makes many of the pushes and drifts cancel out over a full trip around the device, improving
      confinement.
    </p>

    <h2>Two approaches: tokamak vs stellarator</h2>

    <p>This is where stellarators stand out.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A tokamak creates much of the twist by driving a large electric current through the plasma itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        A stellarator creates most of the twist using the 3D shape of external magnets, without needing a huge plasma
        current as the main source of confinement.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This difference matters because driving a large current through a plasma is powerful, but it can also make the
      plasma harder to control and is linked to certain sudden loss-of-confinement events. Stellarators aim for a
      magnetic structure that is naturally suited to steady, long-duration operation.
    </p>

    <h2>Why stellarators are hard</h2>

    <p>
      A big advantage of simpler, symmetric designs is that symmetry gives you conservation laws that are built into the
      geometry and help keep particle motion easier to model. When you move to a fully 3D magnetic shape, you lose a
      lot of that symmetry.
    </p>

    <p>In a generic 3D field, particles can drift outward more easily.</p>

    <p>Modern stellarators fight this with careful design:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>shape the magnetic field so particle drifts average out</li>
      <li>make outward tendencies cancel over time (often discussed under ideas like <em>quasi-isodynamicity</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You might see phrases like <em>optimised stellarator</em> for exactly this reason: a device whose magnetic geometry
      has undergone heavy computational testing and iteration.
    </p>

    <h2>The plasma pushes back</h2>

    <p>
      A hot plasma exerts pressure. Magnetic fields provide a restoring squeeze against the plasma’s outward push. A key
      measure is beta, \( \beta \), the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Higher \( \beta \) is attractive because it means greater plasma performance for a given magnet strength, which is
      good for future power plants. But higher pressure can also trigger instabilities. So stellarator design must
      balance:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>good confinement</li>
      <li>stability at high pressure</li>
      <li>a magnetic geometry that is possible to build</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Turbulence</h2>

    <p>
      Even with great magnetic design, the plasma does not behave nicely. It is turbulent, meaning it is full of small
      swirling motions that can carry heat outward.
    </p>

    <p>In practice you are always fighting two kinds of loss:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>drifts (particles drifting in a 3D field)</li>
      <li>turbulent losses (plasma micro-instabilities moving heat outward)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The best stellarators try to reduce the first without making the second worse, which is part of why this is still
      such an active field.
